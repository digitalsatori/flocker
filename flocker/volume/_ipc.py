"""Inter-process communication for the volume manager.

Specific volume managers ("nodes") may wish to push data to other
nodes. In the current iteration this is done over SSH using a blocking
API. In some future iteration this will be replaced with an actual
well-specified communication protocol between daemon processes using
Twisted's event loop (https://github.com/ClusterHQ/flocker/issues/154).
